4. ERROR! Since we defined the variable using "let", the variable is only visible inside the if statement it was declared in. The result variable is not defined outside of the if statement. 
5. ERROR! Since result is a "const" variable, it cannot be reassigned.
6. ERROR! Similarly to "let", "const" variables are only visible inside of their block, so a "const" variable that was declared in an if statement will not be visible outside of it.
